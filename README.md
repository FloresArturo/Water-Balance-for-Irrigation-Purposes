# Water-Balance-for-Irrigation-Purposes
## Basic water balance that will help design an irrigation system based on historical data about weather patterns from POWER project of NASA.

The water requirement of any crop must be satisfied to achieve potential yields. In order to do so, nature provides some of its requirements, but due to a wide variety of factors it´s not enough. In order to address the situation, irrigation systems are designed based on the crop and environmental requirements. 
Irrigation consists in the artificial application of water to the soil through different dispersion systems. The requirement of water is also known as Evotranspiration, which consists in the water lost to the environment by transpiration of water through the stomata of leaves; and the water evaporated directly from the soil. This process is also known as ETc and varies with the development stage of the crop. Depending on the stage, a constant (kc) is multiplied by the ETc in order to obtain the real Evapotranspiration (ETr). Irrigation systems are created to provide crops with the required amount of water and cover the ETr under specific conditions.

In order to design an efficient irrigation system, the first step should be to study the environment and determine how much water is available for the crop. Rain is the main source of water for the system, but soil properties determine how much water can be retained and delivered for the plants’ use. When nature fails to provide enough water for the crop, irrigation systems are designed to cover this difference.

A water balance is a tool that allows to know the amount of water that will be available for the crop. Historic precipitation, runoff, percolation, soil retention and crop requirements are taken into consideration in order to calculate the water deficit that the irrigation system must deliver. With this kind of tools, the system can be designed precisely for the present conditions, and it can make a better use of water resources. Water balances help determine the critical moments in which water will be needed, therefore, when the system should be used. 

When designing an irrigation system, besides knowing the crop requirements, soil and type of system will have a direct influence on the design. With the improvement of computers and software’s, designing these kinds of systems can be easily achieved. In the following documents, the objective is to create a tool that can help create a yearly water balance for the designer to focus on designing and not in studying historical weather data by getting the approximated crop need for a year period. Tools like Python are useful to automatize tasks and create small Artificial Intelligence programs.

Instructions:
  1. Download the notebook and the excel file to a known location, both should be together.
  2. The notebook provided will allow the user to obtain data from an online website related to weather conditions. Step by step is explained on the file.
  3. After getting the notebook steps done, the excel file 'Water_Balance.xslx' will create a water balance for the location over a year time-period. It requires some   basic information about soil and crop coefficient. More on this topics can be found at 'Irrigation Scheduling' (1).
